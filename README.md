**MLOps or Machine Learning Operations** is a concept that can help you:implement CI/CD applied to machine learning and create an automated infrastructure to support your AI processes.


**With this solution template you can:**
</br></br>
1. Create/operate an automated ML pipeline using a a CI/CD tool CodePipeline, to orchestrate the ML workflow.
</br></br>
2. Create a Docker container from scratch with your own algorithm.
</br></br>
3. Automatically start a training/deployment job by uploading data to S3.
</br></br>
4. Run A/B tests and more. 
</br></br>

This also can be considered a reference architecture that can be used as an inspiration to create your own solution!
